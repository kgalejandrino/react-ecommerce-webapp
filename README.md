# Nemirk Pc Build

A client side rendered React single page application, utilizing Firebase for backend (storing data) and built using create-react-app.

## Summary
This project is (would have been my) proposal to a friend who ask me to create a website for his business. But with less knowledge in back-end, I can't just create a full stack application just yet. With that, I gather this idea and took it as an inspiration to create my first react application. 

Built with features of what a typical ecommerce website should have. User can view item details, add items to the cart, and checkout items in the cart. Implemented using Firebase realtime database to fetch product data and sent order information (to save items added in the cart).
