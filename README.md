## Summary
This project was suppose to be my proposal to a friend who ask me to create a website for his business. But with less knowledge in back-end, I'm not just capable of builing a full stack application just yet. So the idea around this project was to create an ecommerce website focusing on the front-end logic.

Built with features of what a typical ecommerce website should have where user can view item details, add items to the cart, and checkout items.
